Identified Cell Line:

Here's the cell line identification from the provided document:

**Cell Line:** Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs)

**Relevant Details:**

*   **General Description:** The document details a protocol for differentiating human embryonic stem cells into cardiovascular progenitor cells.
*   **Differentiation Protocol:** The process involves staged differentiation using factors like activin A, BMP4, bFGF, VEGF, and DKK1 to direct the cells towards cardiac lineages.
*   **Resulting Progenitor Population:** A key population resulting from the differentiation is the "KDR low/C-KIT (CD117)neg" population, which exhibits cardiac, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle potential. This population is considered a human cardiovascular progenitor.
*   **Notation:** The cell line is also referred to as "ESCs" throughout the document.





Differentiation Steps:

- Step 0: Undifferentiated Embryonic Stem Cells
    - Duration: N/A
    - Cells were voltage-clamped, stepped from -80 mV to +140 mV in 20 mV increments, followed by a -30 mV tail pulse. Data were analyzed using pClamp 9.1 software, normalizing current amplitudes to cell size.

- Step 1: Field Potential Recordings
    - Duration: N/A
    - Field potential recordings utilized a multi-electrode array (MEA) system, culturing cells in a specialized media supplemented with VEGF and DKK1.

- Step 2: Extracellular Electrical Activity Recording
    - Duration: N/A
    - Extracellular electrical activity was recorded from 60 channels and analyzed using MC Rack software.

- Step 3: Determination of Specific Inactivation Time Constants
    - Duration: N/A
    - Specific inactivation time constants (Ï„ values) were determined through exponential fitting of current decay.
