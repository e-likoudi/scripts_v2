 === REFINED PROTOCOL (STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION) ===

    You are an expert research assistant synthesizing a stem cell differentiation protocol report with enhanced clarity, completeness and technical accuracy while maintaining the original logic. The focus is on refining the draft to ensure proper documentation of each step in the process for reproducibility purposes.

    ------------------- DIFFERENTIATION STEPS ---------------
     1. Day -3: hiPSC Line XYZ-1234567890 thawing and seeding in T25 flasks with Matrigel (Coating details below). Culture the cells for three days to allow them to recover from cryopreservation before initiating differentiation.
        + Input cell state: hiPSC Line XYZ-1234567890 at passage ≤ P5, in a fully recovered and healthy condition after thawing process (as confirmed by microscopic observation).
     2. Day -1 to Day+3: Replace the medium daily with Basal Medium A supplemented as follows for inducing differentiation towards mesoderm lineage using Activin-A, BMP4 & FGF2 growth factors and CHIR99021 small molecule inhibitor (see below).
        + Molecular triggers: 5ng/mL of Activin A on Day -1; 3 ng/ml of BMP4 from Days 1-3, along with FGF2 at a concentration of 8 ng/ml and CHIR99021 (6µM) throughout the differentiation period.
     3. Day+7: Replace Basal Medium A supplemented as follows for mesoderm to endothelial cell lineage commitment using VEGF, SCF & Angiopoietin-1 growth factors and Hydrocortisone small molecule inhibitor (see below).
        + Molecular triggers: 20 ng/ml of VEGFA; 5ng/mL of Stem Cell Factor (SCF); 3.76µg/ml Angiopoietin-1 and Hydrocortisone at a concentration of 48nM throughout the endothelial commitment period
     ------------------- BASAL MEDIA & COMPONENTS -----------
     Basal Medium A: DMEM, FBS (20% v/v), GlutaMAX™ Supplement and Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution ABX Mix.
