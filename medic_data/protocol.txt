**Summary:**

This study investigated the presence of a comparable cardiovascular progenitor in human cardiogenesis, mirroring findings from mouse models. The primary objective was to identify a KDR-expressing progenitor cell population within human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived embryoid bodies. The method involved inducing hESC differentiation using a specific cocktail of growth factors: activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF/VEGFA), and dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1) in serum-free media.  The critical component was the identification of a KDRlow/C-KIT (CD117)neg cell population. The key finding was the generation of this KDRlow/C-KITneg population within the embryoid bodies, demonstrating the presence of a multi-lineage cardiovascular progenitor cell population in human differentiation cultures, capable of differentiating into cardiac, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages.



This research section details the identification and characterization of a novel human cardiovascular progenitor cell and the methodology used to direct human embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation towards the cardiac lineage. The primary objective was to pinpoint an early-stage human cardiovascular progenitor and define the role of specific signaling pathways in cardiac development.

The study employed a staged protocol to differentiate human ESCs. Initially, a primitive-streak-like population was generated (Stage 1). Subsequently, cardiac mesoderm was induced and specified (Stage 2), followed by expansion of cardiovascular lineages (Stage 3). A critical step involved utilizing a combination of activin A and BMP4 during Stage 1 to promote cardiac development, building upon previous findings demonstrating their role in ESC cardiac differentiation. Limiting dilution studies and cell-mixing experiments were used to confirm clonal origin of observed cell populations. The identified KDRlow/C-KITneg population, capable of differentiating into cardiomyocytes and generating colonies containing cardiac, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages, is proposed as a key early-stage human cardiovascular progenitor.This research section details a staged differentiation protocol to generate cardiac mesoderm from pluripotent stem cells. The primary objective was to mimic early mouse development to induce cardiac progenitor specification *in vitro*. The method involved two distinct stages. **Stage 1** utilized activin A and BMP4 to induce a primitive-streak-like population, confirmed by transient upregulation of *T* (brachyury) and *WNT3A*. **Stage 2** introduced DKK1, a WNT inhibitor, to specify cardiac mesoderm, alongside VEGF to promote KDR1+ cell expansion. bFGF was reintroduced on day 8 to further support cell expansion. Critical components included activin A, BMP4, DKK1, VEGF, and bFGF, with concentrations varied as indicated in the accompanying figure. The study employed a time-dependent addition of growth factors to sequentially guide differentiation.This research section details a protocol for cardiac lineage specification from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The primary objective was to optimize differentiation conditions to enhance the generation of cardiac cells, specifically those expressing cardiac troponin T (CTNT1).

The methodology involved a staged differentiation protocol. Initially (Stage 5), hESCs were cultured in embryoid bodies (EBs) with BMP4, bFGF, and Activin A. Subsequently (Stage 1), WNT signaling was modulated via WNT3A and DKK1 manipulation to assess their impact on cardiac differentiation. VEGF was introduced at Stage 2 to evaluate its effect on CTNT+ cell numbers. Finally, Stage 3 involved varying combinations of growth factors (BMP4, bFGF, Activin A) and VEGF concentrations.

Findings revealed that modulation of WNT signaling significantly impacted CTNT1 cell development. Furthermore, VEGF concentration at Stage 2 directly correlated with the total number of CTNT1 cells generated. The protocol outlines a stepwise approach to cardiac differentiation, highlighting the critical roles of WNT signaling and VEGF in achieving efficient cardiac cell specification.This research section investigates the role of WNT signaling in cardiac lineage development from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The primary objective was to determine the impact of varying vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations during stage 2 on the number of cardiac troponin T positive (CTNT1) cells generated by day 14.

The method involved culturing hESCs and monitoring cardiac differentiation, evidenced by the emergence of contracting embryoid bodies and expression of cardiac markers like CTNT, a-actinin, and myosin heavy chain. The highest frequency of CTNT1 cells was observed between days 14 and 16. A key component of the study was the planned investigation of WNT signaling pathway inhibition, informed by previous research demonstrating its necessity for cardiac development in other systems. Statistical significance was determined using *P* values, with thresholds of *P* < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 indicating significance.



This research section investigates the factors influencing cardiac lineage emergence from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), specifically focusing on stage 2 differentiation. The primary objective was to identify key signaling pathways and growth factors critical for cardiac specification.

The study employed a stepwise differentiation protocol, initially inducing a primitive streak population using BMP4/activin-A. Subsequently, the impact of modulating the canonical WNT pathway was assessed. DKK1 addition at day 4 significantly increased the frequency of cardiac troponin T-positive (CTNT1) cells, while WNT3A suppressed their development. Further experimentation examined the individual and combined effects of BMP4, activin A, and bFGF during the induction stage (stage 1). Results indicated that while BMP4 and activin A alone had limited effect, the combination of all three factors yielded the highest frequency (40-50%) and number of CTNT1 cells. VEGF was deemed non-essential but its addition increased the total number of CTNT1 cells generated.



This section investigates the molecular events during human embryoid body (EB) differentiation, specifically focusing on the emergence of cardiac lineages. The primary objective was to determine if human cardiac progenitors originate from a KDR-positive population, analogous to findings in mouse models.

The study employed a time-course molecular analysis of developing EBs, tracking gene expression patterns. Key steps included: (1) establishing a primitive-streak-like population within the EBs; (2) monitoring expression of KDR, C-KIT, DKK1, ISL1, NKX2.5, TBX5, TBX20, MLC2A, and CTNT; and (3) correlating expression patterns with stages of cardiac development. A critical component was the use of C-KIT as a marker for early vascular and hematopoietic progenitors. Findings revealed upregulation of DKK1, KDR, ISL1, NKX2.5, TBX5, TBX20, MLC2A, and CTNT at specific time points, indicating a sequential progression of cardiac developmental events.This section details the characterization of three distinct cell populations derived from differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The objective was to identify the developmental potential of these populations, categorized as KDRhigh/C-KIT1 (III), KDRlow/C-KITneg (I), and KDRneg/C-KIT1 (II), which were induced via BMP4 and activin A.

The method involved analyzing gene expression profiles within each population at 6 days of differentiation. Critical components included the surface markers KDR and C-KIT, alongside genes such as CD31, VE-cadherin, SMA, GATA1, NKX2.5, ISL1, TBX5, OCT4, FOXA2, SOX17, SOX1, and PAX6.

Findings revealed that population III (KDRhigh/C-KIT1) expressed vascular and hematopoietic markers, suggesting progenitors of these lineages. Population I (KDRlow/C-KITneg) exhibited expression of cardiac development genes. Population II (KDRneg/C-KIT1) displayed markers indicative of primitive streak-like cells and early endoderm commitment, with minimal neuroectodermal differentiation.This research section investigates a specific population of cells within embryoid bodies (EBs) – identified as KDRlow/C-KITneg – and its potential for cardiac differentiation. The objective was to characterize this population and assess its cardiomyocyte differentiation capacity.

The study employed flow cytometric analysis of EBs at various ages to identify and track the emergence of three distinct populations: KDRhigh/C-KIT1, KDRlow/C-KITneg, and KDRneg/C-KIT1. Subsequently, the KDRlow/C-KITneg population was cultured both as aggregates in suspension and as adherent monolayers. Differentiation was assessed by monitoring the appearance of CTNT1 (troponin T) positive cells.

Findings revealed that the KDRlow/C-KITneg population exhibited the highest cardiomyocyte differentiation potential. After 7-10 days of culture, approximately 40% of aggregates and over 50% of monolayers differentiated into CTNT1-positive cardiomyocytes, demonstrating efficient cardiac lineage commitment. This contrasts with the other identified EB populations.This research section investigates the differentiation potential of distinct cell populations isolated from day-6 embryoid bodies, specifically those defined by KDR and C-KIT expression. The primary objective was to characterize the cardiac differentiation capacity of KDRhigh/C-KIT1, KDRlow/C-KITneg, and KDRneg/C-KIT1 populations.

The methodology involved three key steps: (1) Isolation of the three cell populations; (2) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis to assess gene expression, normalizing to cyclophilin; and (3) *in vitro* culture of the populations as monolayers and aggregates in low-cluster wells, supplemented with VEGF (10 ng/ml), DKK1 (150 ng/ml), and bFGF (10 ng/ml) to promote cardiac differentiation. CTNT1 cell frequency was assessed after 10 and 7-10 days of culture, respectively. Statistical significance was determined using P-values (P < 0.01, P < 0.001).



Critical components included the defined cell populations, VEGF, DKK1, bFGF, and CTNT1 as a marker of cardiac differentiation.This research section details a protocol for deriving cardiomyocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The primary objective was to optimize differentiation conditions to yield cardiomyocytes while minimizing contamination from other cell lineages. The method involved an induction protocol that routinely resulted in the synchronous contraction of cell aggregates. KDRlow/C-KITneg cells, a key intermediate population, expanded 1.5-fold in aggregates and 3-fold in monolayer cultures, yielding an estimated one cardiomyocyte per four input hESCs. Kinetic analysis using the H1 hESC line revealed the emergence of the three KDR/C-KIT populations at day 5, rather than day 6. Gene expression analysis (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, cardiac development, and maturation genes. Notably, the absence of expression for several genes indicated minimal contamination from neuroectoderm, endoderm, or somitic mesoderm. Flow cytometry was also employed for analysis.Here's a concise summary of the provided section, adhering to your requirements:

**Summary**

This study investigated the differentiation potential of KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells cultured in vitro. The primary objective was to characterize the lineage commitment of this cell population and assess the influence of bFGF on differentiation.

**Methods:** Researchers cultured KDRlow/C-KITneg cells for 10-12 days in media supplemented with VEGF and DKK1. Subsequently, bFGF was added to a subset of cultures. Lineage commitment was assessed via flow cytometric analysis for SMA, CTNT, and CD31 expression. Immunostaining was employed to confirm the presence of endothelial (CD31, VE-cadherin, von Willebrand factor), cardiomyocyte (CTNT), and vascular smooth muscle (SMA, SMHC, caldesmon) markers. Finally, the impact of VEGF and bFGF on tube-like structure formation was evaluated via Matrigel-coated coverslip cultures.

**Findings:** Flow cytometry revealed that 90% of cells expressed SMA, 50% expressed CTNT, and 4% expressed CD31. bFGF addition reduced CTNT and SMA expression while increasing CD31. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of multiple endothelial, cardiomyocyte, and VSM markers. Furthermore, KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells formed tube-like structures when cultured with VEGF and bFGF.



This research section investigates the developmental potential of KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells, originating from a GFP-expressing hES2 cell line. The primary objective was to confirm their endothelial phenotype *in vitro* and to document their differentiation capacity *in vivo*.

The study employed a two-stage approach. First, *in vitro* characterization involved Matrigel-coated coverslips to assess CD31 expression and Dil-AC-LDL uptake, confirming an endothelial phenotype. Second, *in vivo* studies transplanted these cells into NOD/SCID mice and SCID beige mice with infarcted hearts. Histological analysis, utilizing epifluorescence and anti-GFP antibody staining, detected donor cells within the grafts.

Notably, teratoma formation was absent in all transplanted animals.



This section investigates the differentiation potential of KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells. The primary objective was to characterize these cells and assess the impact of specific growth factors on their differentiation.

The study employed a stepwise approach: first, KDRlow/C-KITneg cells were cultured with a cocktail of VEGF (10 ng/ml), DKK1 (150 ng/ml), and bFGF (10 ng/ml). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was then used to analyze gene expression (normalized to cyclophilin) at various time points (D7, D8, D10, D14, D18, D22) following plating. Subsequently, flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the differentiation of these cells after 10-12 days of culture. Immunostaining was performed to further characterize the derived lineages.

Key findings included a significant increase in ejection fraction (31%) in hearts injected with the KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived population compared to media alone. qRT-PCR analysis revealed dynamic gene expression patterns over time. The addition of bFGF was observed to influence differentiation pathways. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of characteristic cardiovascular markers within the derived cell populations.This section investigates cardiac and vascular lineage derivation from a KDRlow/C-KITneg cell population isolated from the mouse heart. The primary objective was to characterize the differentiation potential of these cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

**Methods:** Firstly, *in vitro* cultures of KDRlow/C-KITneg cells were stimulated with VEGF, DKK1, and bFGF to assess cardiac differentiation, followed by immunostaining for cardiac troponin T (CTNT) and smooth muscle actin (SMA). Secondly, cells were cultured on Matrigel and assessed for von Willebrand factor and Dil-AC-LDL uptake to evaluate endothelial differentiation. Finally, *in vivo* cardiac grafts were generated using GFP-expressing KDRlow/C-KITneg cells, followed by immunohistochemical analysis of donor-derived cells using antibodies against GFP, α-actinin, PECAM (CD31), and smooth muscle MHC.

**Findings:** *In vitro* cultures demonstrated the emergence of cells expressing both CTNT and SMA, suggesting cardiac differentiation. Dil-AC-LDL uptake confirmed endothelial differentiation. *In vivo*, grafted cells were observed to integrate into the host heart tissue, expressing GFP and exhibiting markers of cardiac (α-actinin) and vascular (CD31, smooth muscle MHC) lineages.This research section investigates the lineage relationships between cardiac, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell types derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The primary objective was to determine if a single population of ESC-derived cells could differentiate into all three cell types.

The method employed was an adaptation of the methylcellulose colony assay, a standard technique for identifying cardiovascular progenitors. KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived ESCs were plated in methylcellulose and cultured for four days. Individual colonies were then analyzed via PCR to assess the expression of cardiac (CTNT), endothelial (CD31, CDH5), and VSM (SMA, calponin) markers.

The findings revealed that KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived ESCs formed small, compact colonies within four days. PCR analysis confirmed the co-expression of markers characteristic of cardiac, endothelial, and VSM lineages within these colonies, suggesting a shared developmental origin for these cell types.This section investigates the clonal origin of cardiovascular colonies derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The primary objective was to demonstrate that these colonies originate from a single cardiovascular colony-forming cell (hCV-CFC).

The study employed two key methods to assess clonality. First, a mixing assay combined KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells from GFP-hES2 and RFP-expressing hESC lines within a methylcellulose assay. Second, a cell-dose response experiment examined the correlation between plated cell number and colony formation. Immunostaining was also utilized to confirm the presence of cardiac, endothelial, and VSM lineages within the colonies.

Findings revealed that colonies developed expressing either GFP or RFP, excluding cell aggregation. The cell-dose response experiment exhibited a linear relationship with a slope near one, further supporting single-cell derivation. Immunostaining confirmed the presence of multiple lineages. These results collectively support the conclusion that the observed colonies represent clonal populations of cardiovascular cells.This section investigates the functional characteristics of cardiomyocytes derived from KDRlow/C-KITneg cells, a novel human cardiovascular colony-forming cell (hCV-CFC). The primary objective was to assess the electrophysiological properties and lineage potential of these cells, comparing them to established cardiac myocyte characteristics and existing stem cell research.

The study employed whole-cell voltage-clamp and microelectrode field potential recordings. In the voltage-clamp analysis, 80% of cells exhibited a transient outward potassium current (Ito) with properties mirroring those observed in human atrial and ventricular myocytes. Microelectrode recordings confirmed electrical coupling between the derived cardiac cells. The effect of quinidine, a Vaughan Williams class-Ia agent, on T-wave amplitude and QT interval was also assessed.

Findings suggest that human cardiovascular development shares similarities with murine models, with the hCV-CFC potentially giving rise to cardiac, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages. The observed characteristics align with recent identification of similar cardiac stem cells in adult human hearts, further supporting the existence of common progenitor cells.This research section investigates the differentiation of cardiovascular progenitors from human embryonic stem cell (hESC) cultures, focusing on the identification and characterization of a distinct KDRlow/C-KITneg population. The primary objective was to identify a specific hESC subpopulation enriched for cardiovascular progenitor potential.

The study employed a plating assay, varying the number of cells plated (1x10^3 to 1x10^3) and monitoring colony formation. A baseline condition was compared to experimental conditions involving the addition of bFGF, WNT3A, and DKK1. The researchers observed that the KDRlow/C-KITneg fraction was identified as containing these cardiovascular progenitors. This segregation mirrors findings in mouse ESC cultures and suggests a conserved developmental mechanism between human and murine systems. The identified population offers a valuable resource for further investigation into cardiac development and for potential *in vitro* tissue engineering and transplantation applications.This research section details the identification and characterization of human cardiovascular progenitors derived from mixed cultures of ESCs. The primary objective was to isolate and define a specific population of cells exhibiting cardiovascular lineage potential.

The method involved culturing ESCs expressing either RFP or GFP, followed by isolation of colonies appearing at Day 4. Immunostaining (SMA, CTNT, VE-cad, DAPI, RFP, GFP, KDR, CD31, VE-cad, ISL1, Calponin, TBX5, CTNT, ACTB) was performed on isolated colonies to assess marker expression. A cell-dose response assay (plating KDRlow/C-KITneg cells) was used to determine colony formation dependency. Finally, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted on KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells to assess native Ito current.

**Methods:** hESC lines were maintained and differentiated using a specific cytokine cocktail over an 8-day period. This included BMP4, bFGF, activin A, DKK1, and VEGF, administered at varying concentrations and durations. Cultures were initially maintained in a 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 environment, transitioning to a 5% CO2/air environment after 10-12 days. Subsequently, KDRlow/C-KITneg cells were isolated and cultured as monolayers. Electrical activity was assessed using a multi-channel electrode array (MEA) and analyzed to determine time-to-peak current and inactivation times. Quinidine (1mM) was used to modulate electrical activity.

**Findings:** Eight out of ten cells exhibited Ito current, and mean current densities were plotted. Analysis of electrical activity revealed specific temporal characteristics, and the impact of quinidine was observed via MEA recordings. A model depicting the development of cardiovascular progenitors (hCV-CFC) from human ESC cultures was also presented.This section details in vitro and in vivo methodologies employed to investigate the differentiation potential of KDRlow/C-KITneg cells.

Subsequently, in vivo experiments involved injecting 100,000 KDRlow/C-KITneg cells into NOD/SCID-c mice, followed by immunohistochemical analysis of harvested hearts at 2-11 weeks post-injection, using antibodies against GFP, α-actinin, CD31, and SM-MHC. A separate experiment induced myocardial infarction in SCID beige mice, followed by injection of KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells (n=59) or media (n=512), with ventricular function assessed via MRI two weeks later.



This research investigates the molecular mechanisms driving cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineage differentiation from Flk-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells. The study builds upon prior research identifying key signaling pathways involved in heart development, including Nodal, BMP-2/FGF-4, Wnt, FGF receptor, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-4 (BMP-4). 

The researchers synthesized existing literature to establish a framework for understanding cardiac development. They analyzed the roles of various growth factors and signaling pathways, referencing studies demonstrating the necessity of Nodal for primitive streak formation, the synergistic effect of BMP-2 and FGF-4 in inducing cardiogenesis, the inhibitory role of Wnt activity, the requirement for FGF receptor signaling, and the function of BMP-4 in mesoderm patterning. The study ultimately aims to elucidate the complex interplay of these factors in directing progenitor cell differentiation into specialized cardiac cell types.
This compilation of research papers investigates cardiogenesis and cardiac cell differentiation, drawing from studies across various model organisms and employing diverse methodologies.

The primary objective was to characterize membrane currents and extracellular electrical activity in cultured KDRlow/C-KITneg cells.

**Methods:** Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using a recording solution containing specific concentrations of KCl, EGTA, HEPES, and glucose. Cells were voltage-clamped, stepped from -80 mV to +140 mV in 20 mV increments, followed by a -30 mV tail pulse. Data were analyzed using pClamp9.1 software, normalizing current amplitudes to cell size. Field potential recordings utilized a Multi Channel Systems MEA, culturing cells in StemPro34 with VEGF and DKK1, transitioning to DMEM with FBS two days prior to recording. Sixty channels were simultaneously recorded and analyzed with MC Rack software.

**Findings:** Data are presented as mean ± standard error, derived from three independent experiments, with statistical analysis performed using Student’s t-test. Specific inactivation time constants (t values) were determined through single exponential fitting of current decay.
