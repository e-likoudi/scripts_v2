Title: yang2008

Summary:
**Key Steps:**

1. Isolation and culture of KDRlow/C-KITneg cells
2. Addition of VEGF, bFGF, and DKK1 to the culture medium
3. Colony formation by KDRlow/C-KITneg cells in methylcellulose containing growth factors
4. Histological analysis using immuno-histochemistry with various antibodies
5. Confocal imaging for colocalization analysis

**Critical Components:**

* KDRlow/C-KITneg cells
* VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)
* bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor)
* DKK1 (Dickkopf-1)
* Methylcellulose
* Immuno-histochemistry antibodies (GFP, Î±-actinin, CD31, and smooth muscle MHC)

**Special Conditions:**

* Culture medium containing VEGF, bFGF, and DKK1
* 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 environment for colony formation
* In vivo injection of bFGF and DKK1 into the left ventricular wall of NOD/SCID-gamma mice

**Note:** The study aims to explore the potential of bFGF and DKK1 in promoting cardiac tissue regeneration after infarction.
