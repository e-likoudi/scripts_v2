Differentiation Protocol:

Here is a structured version of the protocol based on the provided text:

**Step 0: Undifferentiated Cells**

* Cell line: N/A
* Source: NOD/SCID-gamma mice or SCID beige mice
* Media: DMEM (Mediatech) with 15% FBS
* Initial cell type: KDRlow/C-KITneg cells

**Step 1: Preparation of Undifferentiated Cells**

* Cells were isolated from day-6 embryoid bodies using trypsin.
* Cells were cultured in StemPro34 medium with VEGF (10 ng/ml), bFGF (10 ng/ml), and DKK1 (150 ng/ml) for 5-10 days.

**Step 2: Differentiation Induction**

* Cells were injected directly into the left ventricular wall of NOD/SCID-gamma mice or SCID beige mice in an open-chest procedure.
* Hearts were harvested 2-11 weeks post-surgery, fixed in 1% PFA in cacodylate buffer and sectioned at 10mm.

**Step 3: Immunohistochemistry**

* Immuno-histochemistry was done with GFP (Chemicon), a-actinin (Sigma), CD31 (Dako), and smooth muscle MHC antibodies (Biomedical Technologies).
* Confocal images were analyzed for colocalization using ImageJ and Pierre Bourdoncleâ€™s plugin.

**Step 4: In Vivo Assays**

* Ventricular function was assessed using 9.4 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging.
* Patch-clamp recordings were performed on KDRlow/C-KITneg cells cultured in a MEA (Multi Channel Systems) chamber in StemPro34 with 10 ng/ml VEGF and 150 ng/ml DKK1 for 2-4 weeks.

**Step 5: Final Differentiated State**

* The final differentiated state of the cells is KDRlow/C-KITneg-derived cells, which are capable of forming tube-like structures, expressing endothelial markers such as CD31 and VE-cadherin, and contributing to myocardial regeneration in infarcted hearts.

Note that this is a simplified version of the protocol, and some steps may overlap or be missing. Additionally, the specific details of each step may vary depending on the context and requirements of the experiment.
